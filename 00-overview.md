# Enterprise Security Operations Overview

Modern enterprise security follows a continuous cycle:

Detect → Investigate → Respond → Prevent

AI systems like Microsoft Security Copilot assist analysts by accelerating investigation and decision-making, not replacing them.

Security Copilot sits in the investigation layer:
- Collects security signals
- Correlates events
- Explains incidents
- Suggests remediation

This represents the transition of SOC operations:
Manual → Assisted → Automated
