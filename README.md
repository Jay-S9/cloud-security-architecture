# Cloud Security Architecture

This repository documents my learning and understanding of enterprise cloud security systems using Microsoft Azure security tools.

The goal is not course notes, but to understand how large organizations (especially financial institutions) protect infrastructure, data, and transactions in real-world environments.

Focus areas:
- Identity & access protection
- Infrastructure hardening
- Threat detection & monitoring (SIEM)
- Incident response (XDR)
- AI-assisted security operations

All entries are written as system understanding rather than theoretical summaries.
