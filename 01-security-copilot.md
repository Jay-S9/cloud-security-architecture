# Security Copilot

## What it is
Microsoft Security Copilot is an AI-assisted security analysis system that helps security teams investigate and respond to threats using natural language queries.

It connects to enterprise security data (logs, alerts, identities, endpoints) and generates contextual explanations of incidents.

## Purpose in real systems
In large organizations thousands of alerts occur daily. Security analysts cannot manually correlate all events.

Security Copilot reduces investigation time by:
- summarizing incidents
- correlating related activities
- suggesting remediation actions

This improves SOC (Security Operations Center) efficiency and incident response speed.

## How it works (conceptual)
1. Analyst submits prompt
2. System grounds response using security telemetry
3. AI correlates events across tools
4. Generates investigation + response guidance

## Connected services
- Microsoft Defender (endpoint & threat signals)
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM logs)
- Microsoft Entra (identity activity)
- Other Microsoft security platforms

## Why important for financial systems
Banks require fast detection and response to prevent fraud, account takeover, and data breaches.

AI-assisted investigation reduces response latency and human error in high-volume security environments.

## Problem it solves
Organizations face two major security challenges:
- Increasing volume and complexity of cyberattacks
- Shortage of skilled security analysts

Security Copilot allows analysts to process security signals at machine speed, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) and enabling faster containment of threats.
