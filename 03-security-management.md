# Security Management (Defender for Cloud)

Focus:
Continuous monitoring and improvement of cloud security posture.

Unlike infrastructure security (preventive controls),
this layer identifies misconfigurations and active threats.

Key idea:
Security is not a one-time setup — it is continuously evaluated.
