# Security Management (Defender for Cloud)

Focus:
Continuous monitoring and improvement of cloud security posture.

Unlike infrastructure security (preventive controls),
this layer identifies misconfigurations and active threats.

Key idea:
Security is not a one-time setup — it is continuously evaluated.

## Security Posture Concept
Cloud environments constantly change — new resources, configuration updates, and user actions can weaken security.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud continuously evaluates the environment to detect risks, misconfigurations, and active threats.

Security becomes an ongoing process rather than a one-time configuration.
